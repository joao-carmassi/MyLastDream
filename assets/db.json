    "texto": "I’m João, a web developer by day and an amateur photographer by passion. A gaymer at heart, and above all, someone deeply in love with my partner. After discovering the magical camera item in Sky: Children of the Light, I found a way to blend all my loves into one place capturing the journey we share through the lens, each photo a reflection of our adventure together, soaring through a world that feels as infinite as our bond.",
